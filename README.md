# Color_detection_System
#In this mini-project, we delve into the fascinating world of colour detection and visualization using Arduino and the TCS3200 colour sensor. Understanding colours and their presence in our surroundings is crucial in various applications such as quality control, sorting, and even artistic endeavours. The TCS3200 sensor allows us to detect a wide range of colours accurately and efficiently. By interfacing this sensor with Arduino, we can capture colour data and use it to control an RGB LED, reproducing the detected colours in real-time. This project not only demonstrates the capabilities of Arduino in sensor integration but also provides a hands-on experience in colour detection and display, offering a practical insight into the fundamentals of colour sensing and LED control.

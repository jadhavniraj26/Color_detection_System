# Color_detection_System
In this mini-project, of color detection and visualization using Arduino and the TCS3200 color sensor. The TCS3200 sensor allows us to detect a wide range of colors accurately and efficiently. By interfacing this sensor with Arduino, we can capture color data and use it to control an RGB LED, reproducing the detected colors in real-time.
